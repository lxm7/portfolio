Hi, thanks for popping by. I’m Javascript developer living in Leeds and this is just a portfolio site to showcase a few things I’ve been doing for the web recently.

Most of my time is spent leveraging the latest and smartest best practises with React, ES6, Redux, Typescript.

A few other key npm packages used extensively:

* Next
* Apollo v2 / Graphql
* Reselect
* Immutable

A few things on the horizon I’m currently integrating into future projects, likely in this order:

* React Native
* Golang
* More AWS / Terraform / Docker for hosting, orchestrating and automating, repsectively
* More node microservices (simple data aggregator via a cron is the next one on the list)
* PostgresSQL – triggers, pub/subs
* D3JS
* Simple Redis and Kafka demos
* Network+ TIA
* Unity3d
